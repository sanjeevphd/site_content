Hello! 

Welcome to my site, which is a collection of posts (mostly for self-reflection, learning and recall, but if it's beneficial to someone else then it's a bonus!) and a few pages about me. I am a Research Engineer by profession and enjoy working with data, machine learning, Python and on interesting challenges. I also practice meditation, play drums, workout often & read for enjoyment. Have a look around. Thanks for stopping by!
