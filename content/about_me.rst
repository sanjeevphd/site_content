  Sanjeev Malalur, PhD

I am a Research Engineer by profession and enjoy working with data and machine learning, primarily using Python and it's vast and ever growing collection of libraries and frameworks. I also practice meditation, workout often, play the drums, read for enjoyment and juggle. I intend to use this site as a collection of posts - primarily for learning and self-reflection. 

More content coming soon.
