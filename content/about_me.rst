Sanjeev Malalur, PhD

I am a Research Engineer by profession and enjoy working with data and machine learning, primarily using Python and it's vast and ever growing collection of libraries and frameworks. This site is a collection of posts - mostly for self-reflection, learning and recall, and a few pages about me. I also practice meditation, workout often, play drums, read for enjoyment and trying to teach myself how to juggle.
