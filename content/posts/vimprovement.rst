In the beginning...
===================

I have been using vim for a while now. I moved from being a long time PC user to a Mac and was looking for a good editor. TextMate served that purpose for a while, but I was drawn to the "dark side" (aka terminal with a dark background). Very quickly, I hit the famous fork in the well travelled road to console editor bliss - Emacs vs Vim. I did what most would do - googled the heck out of what others thought or experienced. I decided to give both a try. This was not the first time, but it certainly has been a long time and I was never too invested in either when I did use them. Anyway, I started with Emacs mostly cause of org-mode. It is fantastic and for someone who cares about productivity it was the hook!
