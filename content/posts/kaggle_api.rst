summary: "A quick guide to install and use the official Kaggle API, mostly for personal reference"
---


Installation
============

Get the `official Kaggle API <https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api>`_.

.. note::
   Kaggle API does not work with Python 2. Only Python 3 is supported.

A recommended first step is to create a separate virtual environment using the desired environment management tool. In Conda, `conda create -n kaggle` does the job. Next, activate the virtual environment. Again, in Conda, `conda activte kaggle` will get this done. Next, decision time - to `conda` or `pip`? Whenever possible I prefer to `conda install` packages. So, `conda install kaggle -c conda-forge` will get `kaggle` installed.

Use `kaggle --version` to verify the installation succeeded.

Usage
=====

.. note::
   Before using the Kaggle API, be sure to obtain the required API credentials by,

   #. Creating an account on the Kaggle site
   #. Navigate to Account and select 'Create API Token'
   #. Save the resulting `kaggle.json` file to the directory `~/.kaggle` (on \*nix)
   #. For Windows specific instructions or for to use environment variable to setup Kaggle credentials (no local file needed) `see here <https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api#api-credentials>`_
   #. To avoid the `Warning: Your Kaggle API key is readable by other users on this system!` message (ack!), perform a `chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`, which is also included as a part of the warning message, like a good warning message should.
  
Assuming the Kaggle API credentials are in place, you are now ready to start using the command line tool. While listing and general *browsing* of competitions and files are okay, any meaningful interaction requires you to have accepted the competition rules and regulations, which unfortunately can **only** be done via a browser.

**Listing Competitions**

The Kaggle API provides 4 main commands, each with several sub-commands.

- competitions (c)
- datasets (d)
- kernels (k)
- config

It can get tedious to type the lengthy commands, along with the sub-commands and options. Kaggle API provides simple *shorthands* for three of the main commands that I highly recommend using.

**Download Competition Files**

As an example, let's look at the `ASHRAE - Great Energy Predictor III <https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction/overview>`_ competition.

.. code::
   :class: bash

   ~ >>kaggle c list -s ashrae

The downloaded files include a `sample_submission.csv` file. Let's try submitting that file, as is, as our first entry (cause why not?!). Since the inclued sample submission file is a large file, it's better to compress it first (Kaggle API supports zipped/archived file format for submission).

.. code::
   :class: bash

   ~ >>zip sample_submission sample_submission.csv 
   ~ >>kaggle c submit -f sample_submission.csv -c
     adding: sample_submission.csv (deflated 79%)
   ~ >>kaggle c submit ashrae-energy-prediction -f sample_submission.zip -m "Testing Kaggle API submission with dummy file"

How did we do? Let's check the leaderboard for what the top scores are.

In addition the Kaggle API supports browsing, downloading, creating `datasets <https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api#datasets>`_, browsing, pushing and pulling `kernels <https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api#kernels>`_ and API `configuration <https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api#config>`_ that makes it easy to use from the command line.
