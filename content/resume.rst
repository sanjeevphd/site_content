Lead architect for the adoption of machine learning and data driven practices into Probe's Geological Formation Evaluation Platform 

*(2018 - Present)*

   -  Worked with the leadership team and domain experts to expand
      Probe's formation evaluation product line to meet unique
      challenges in unconventional oil reservoir management.
   -  Applied neural networks, statistical signal processing, and convex
      optimization to physical measurements gathered from sensor arrays
      on oil well-logging instruments, and provided solutions for
      identifying oil-producing zones, diagnosing well flow and
      monitoring time-lapsed performance.
   -  Added intellectual property in the form of trademark and trade
      secrets to Probe's portfolio.
   -  Liaised with top-ten international oil and gas companies and
      provided technical assistance for global sales.

Project and technical lead for a commercial data analysis and interpretation platform 

*(2015 - 2017)*
                                                                                                     

   -  Led the design and development of the product. Managed a
      cross-functional team consisting of software engineers, geologists
      and petrophysicists.
   -  Integrated multifaceted oil-well data with machine learning
      algorithms. Created data pipelines and processes for visualizing
      and interacting with data and for optimizing oil production over
      the life of an oil well.
   -  The product established a revenue generating service for
      petrophysics interpretation and attracted international sales.

Built end-to-end data pipelines to automate predictive model generation and consumption 

*(2013 - 2014)*
                                                                                                       

   -  Reduced the time for sensor data analysis and interpretation by
      engineering automation workflows, leading to faster field
      decisions and significant savings in operational expenses.
   -  Developed data processing pipelines to clean, format, transform,
      store and retrieve large amounts of synthetic sensor data
      generated by computer models, using the Monte Carlo N-Particle
      (`MCNP <https://mcnp.lanl.gov/>`__) code.
   -  Leveraged data to build customized statistical models to
      accurately predict unknown geological parameters including rock
      type, porosity, and fluid saturation.
   -  Deployed an internal web application to browse, filter, search,
      and export the models using Python, Flask, and Dash.

Developed a software library for controlling tools and processing data, in real-time, for Geological Formation Evaluation Solution suite 

*(2010 - 2013)*
                                                                                                                                                        

   -  Engineered solutions for quality control, analysis and
      visualization of streaming sensor data in real-time.
   -  Performed applied research on using nuclear technology for
      measuring properties of geological formation. Migrated prototypes
      from research into production ready packages.
   -  Worked effectively as a part of a multi-disciplinary engineering
      team consisting of hardware, firmware, mechanical and software
      engineers.
