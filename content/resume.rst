Experience
==========

Research Engineer Jan. 2010 - Present
-------------------------------------

Probe Technology Services (Following a 2017 merger with `Hunter Well Science <https://www.probe1.com/probe-and-hunter-well-science-announce-strategic-merger/>`__) Fort Worth, TX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Probe, a private multi-national company, engineers and manufactures
cutting-edge technological solutions for the cased-hole oil well logging
and reservoir monitoring - a segment in the Upstream sector of the Oil
and Gas industry, with clients worldwide.*

*Hunter Well Science, founded in Dec. 2009 as a technology startup,
researched, designed, engineered and produced top-tier cased-hole
technologies and petrophysics solutions, moving to full commercial
product offering in 2012. Hunter successfully merged with Probe in Dec.
2017.*

-  Championed the adoption of machine learning and data driven practices
   into Probe's Geological Formation Evaluation Solution Platform

   -  Worked closely with the leadership team and domain experts
      (Geologists & Petrophysicists) to expand Probe's nuclear
      technology product line for challenges in oil reservoir
      management. Translated key business requirements into prototypes
      and iterated on feedback for quick commercial production and
      deployment
   -  Applied neural networks, statistical signal processing & convex
      optimization to advance the research on using physical
      measurements from nuclear logging tools to address unconventional
      reservoir challenges. Resulted in several intellectual properties
      to Probe's portfolio
   -  Implemented best practices around sustainability leading to
      knowledge codification, improved reproducibility and move towards
      data driven methodologies
   -  Liaised with top 10 international oil and gas companies. Provided
      technical assistance for global sales

-  Project & Technical Lead for a commercial, intelligent well-log
   interpretation platform aimed at extracting maximum information from
   wellbore data in order to optimize oil well production over the life
   of the well

   -  Reservoir Analysis System Interpretation Platform (RASiP) is a
      proprietary software that integrates multifaceted well log data
      with innovative algorithms, data pipelines and process workflows
      for gaining key insights into the performance, production
      capabilities and troubleshooting new and mature oil wells. The
      package provides key answers including fluid saturation, rock
      porosity, lithology and volume of shale
   -  Managed a cross-functional team of 5, consisting of software
      engineers, Geologists and Petrophysicists. Gathered requirements,
      translated them into technical specifications, got regular
      feedback on prototypes and delivered the product on time
   -  Led the design and development of the product by coding along side
      the team. Developed intelligent algorithms to estimate subsurface
      parameters. Authored technical and non-technical documents

-  Built end-to-end data pipelines to automate the generation &
   consumption of predictive models

   -  Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP), a general purpose software, can be
      used to accurately simulate nuclear reactions in complex
      environments and generate synthetic data sets for nuclear logging
      tools to mitigate the extremely underdetermined problem of
      subsurface parameter estimation
   -  Developed data processing pipelines that handled large amounts
      synthetic MCNP data and included operations for cleaning,
      formatting, transforming & storing data. Built multiple
      statistical models (regression and neural networks, for instance)
      that used MCNP data to accurately predict subsurface parameters
   -  Deployed an internal web application to browse, filter, search and
      export computer models using Python, Flask and Dash (by Plotly) -
      a key company asset
   -  Reduced time for log interpretation by implementing workflow
      automation, leading to faster field decisions and significant
      savings in operational expenses

-  Developed a real-time software library for controlling and monitoring
   nuclear well-logging tools and for processing and visualizing raw
   streaming sensor data

   -  Quickly built knowledge base about the oil and gas industry,
      cased-hole services and nuclear logging technology by reviewed
      patents, publications and texts
   -  Performed applied research in the area of using nuclear
      well-logging technology for measuring formation properties.
      Engineered solutions for quality control, analysis and
      visualization of data in real-time
   -  Successfully migrated the prototypes from research to production,
      in time for a commercial product launch resulting in successful
      sales and significant market share
   -  Worked effectively as a part of a multi-disciplinary engineering
      team, to design, build, test and deploy a suite of nuclear logging
      tools (consisting of pulsed-neutron and spectral gamma-ray tools)
