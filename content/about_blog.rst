Why?
====

- To improve my writing
- To aid my learning and understanding of concepts
- To have a professional presence online
- To improve social visibility by linking to on my resume, LinkedIn, GitHub and other sites

The Plan
========

- Create a professional site with information about me (picture, bio, resume, etc.), technical posts, projects, publications, etc.
- Use Tumblr site for non-professional posts related to interests, productivity, reflections, etc. - is this even needed? Why not use the professional site for everything? Just make it a site about me
- Post content to - reddit, HN, Twitter, etc. for feedback and discussion
